# Milestone-Project-I
I made a 2D browser game demo version of "Space Invaders" using mainly html, css, and js. The goal is to get the highest score by killing as much aliens as possible before they reach your ship. 

HOW TO PLAY: 
<<<<<<< HEAD
Spacebar: shoot 
Left/right arrow keys: move left/right

I was inpired by the retro style of the game, back when programming was in its bare bone form. I wanted to take it back to the classics times in hopes that it reaches future generations of developers. It also really brung back a nostalgic feel to earlir games I used to play as a kid.
